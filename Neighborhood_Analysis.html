            <p> This Word Cloud demonstrates which neighborhood has the most apartment listings.
                I leveraged this visual as a starting point to understand which neighborhood I should dig deeper into.
                Based on the parameters I set and the 28 apartment listings that were returned, Lower Nob Hill appears to be 
                have the widest variety for what I am looking for.

    <h3>Prices vs Number of Listings</h3>

    <p> Created a violin plot that groups Neighborhoods and compares prices against number of listings. 
        The lines in each plot represent the number of listings. 
        Based on this data, majority of Lower Nob Hill's listings prices raneg between $3K-$3.5K. 
        An outlier in this plot would be the Nob Hill listing that is extremely low compared to other listings.
